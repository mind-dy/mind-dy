I am a rising senior in Booklyn Technical High School and I'm currenly majoring in software engineering and working with JPMC. I've learned coding languages such as Java and Python and I have intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS.
My goal as a coder is to ultilize the skills and knowledge that I've gained to contribute to solving real world problems and give back to the community. I want to continue to learn new language and find new ways to develop programs by being a part of the coding community.
